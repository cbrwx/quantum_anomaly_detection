# Quantum Anomaly Detection and Feature Importance

This code perform anomaly detection and feature importance calculation using quantum algorithms. It uses the Qiskit library to encode datasets into quantum circuits and apply the Quantum Singular Value Thresholding (QSVT) algorithm for anomaly detection. The code also calculates quantum feature importance by analyzing the effect of individual features on the largest eigenvalue.

## How the code works

- **Loading IBM Q credentials and choosing the backend:** The code starts by loading the IBM Q credentials and choosing the `ibmq_16_melbourne` backend to run the quantum circuits.
- **Encoding the dataset:** The `encode_dataset` function takes a dataset as input and creates a quantum circuit that encodes each data point into a quantum state using angle encoding.
- **Swap test:** The `swap_test_circuit` function creates a swap test circuit for two input quantum states, which is used later to compare the similarity between two quantum states.
- **QSVT:** The `qsvt` function applies the Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) algorithm to a given quantum circuit to estimate the largest eigenvalue, which is used for anomaly detection.
- **Adaptive thresholding:** The `adaptive_threshold` function calculates an adaptive threshold for anomaly detection based on the mean distance to the k nearest neighbors.
- **Quantum feature importance:** The `quantum_feature_importance` function calculates the importance of each feature in the dataset by analyzing how much it affects the largest eigenvalue.
- **Anomaly detection:** The `detect_anomalies` function uses the QSVT algorithm to find anomalies in the dataset. Anomalies are data points with eigenvalues below the computed threshold.
- **Optimizing and running the quantum circuits:** The code optimizes the quantum circuits and runs them in batches using the ThreadPoolExecutor.
- **Noise mitigation:** The code applies noise mitigation using the CompleteMeasFitter class from Qiskit Ignis.
- **Calculating similarity between anomalies:** The code performs a swap test between each pair of anomalies to compare their quantum states.
- **Calculating quantum feature importances:** The code calculates the quantum feature importances for each feature in the dataset.

## Requirements

To run this code, you will need:

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Qiskit
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Scipy

## Usage

1. Save the code as `quantum_anomaly_detection.py`.
2. Prepare your dataset as a CSV file named `dataset.csv`.
3. Run the script using the command `python quantum_anomaly_detection.py`.

The script will output the detected anomalies and their respective quantum feature importances.

## Real-world usage

This quantum anomaly detection and feature importance algorithm can be used for various applications, such as:

- Detecting fraud in financial transactions.
- Identifying outliers in sensor data for equipment monitoring and predictive maintenance.
- Finding unusual patterns in network traffic for cybersecurity.
- Discovering abnormal behavior in healthcare data for early detection of diseases.

By calculating quantum feature importances, the algorithm can also help identify the most significant features for further analysis and model building.
Or perhaps better explained as the quantum_feature_importance() function in the code can identify the most important features in the dataset for anomaly detection. The function calculates the impact of each feature on the anomaly detection by measuring the change in the largest eigenvalue of the quantum circuit when a particular feature is flipped. By doing so, the function can give insights into which features are most critical for the anomaly detection task, and you can use this information to refine your analysis, build more accurate models, or conduct further investigations, or even perhaps; as the algorithm helps to pinpoint anomalies and their associated features, one can now channel their inner Sherlock Holmes and conduct further investigations to solve the mystery of these data outliers...
